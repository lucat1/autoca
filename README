Automatic PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) generation and renewal via an idempotent python script.
This tool is meant to be run as a cronjob on a central machine, so that certificates for various hosts can be distributed.
Can be used as a suckless replacement for HashiCorp's Vault when in need for a self-signed PKI.

Serialization tests can be run with:

$ python -m unittest autoca/**/*test.py
